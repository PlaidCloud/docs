Account Types and Navigation
----------------------------

Shared Accounts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Shared accounts provide access to files stored in various locations
including:

- Amazon S3
- Azure Cloud Storage
- Rackspace Cloudfiles
- Dropbox
- Google Drive
- Local Servers via SFTP

Shared account access is controlled in three different modes:

-  Workspace - Share with all members of the current workspace
-  Member - Share with specific members of the workspace
-  Role - Share with specific security groups in the workspace

Only account owners will have the ability to know which type of sharing mode is being
used, members will not. They simply will or will not be able to use the account.

To access shared accounts, first select the main **Document** page then select "Shared Accounts" along the top of the page.
This will open a list of accounts to explore, provided the member has been 
given access to at least one shared account.

|Document Tab SA|


Private Accounts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Private accounts operate much like shared accounts but are only viewable 
by the owners. This is particularly useful for storing sensitive information 
that is not intended for wider sharing.

To access private accounts, first select the main **Document** page then select "My Private Accounts" along the top of the page. This will open a list of accounts to explore, provided the member has 
private accounts already established.

|My Private Accounts Tab|


File Explorer
-------------

Several file operations are available. All operations are accessible from a right-click 
menu within the file browser. The right-click menu provides specific options depending on
whether a folder or file is selected.

To open the file explorer, click on the folder icon (far left) from the list of private or shared accounts.  |Demo Data Icon|

**Folder** options consist of uploading new folders, creating new folders, and renaming, deleting, and downloading current folders as ZIPs while **file** options consist of downloading new files and renaming, deleting, and refreshing current files.
