Organizations and workspaces two layers of multi-tenancy under PlaidCloud with workspaces acting as specific subsets of
organizations. Having the ability to create multiple workspaces under a single organization makes creating and
controlling the security access of teams simple and easy.

Organizations serve as a foundation for PlaidCloud with many workspaces designed to help support unique needs.
Using a multi-tenant workspace service, PlaidCloud allows flexibiliy and eliminates the need to perform
technical configurations for setting up isolated workspace environments. The organization of PlaidCloud is designed 
to provide maximum collaboration flexibility while still planning for the many situations that require privacy and confidentiality.

PlaidCloud's Organization approach makes managing small teams, large teams, and multinational organizations easy.
It allows you to easily integrate authentication and member management into existing systems or, if you choose to,
manage them manually. This is done by using multiple tiers of access control which simultaneously minimizes the
management overhead and keeps your data and activities compartmentalized.

While this may sound a little complex, we kept it as simple as possible so getting started and scaling up is not a daunting endeavor.

PlaidCloud's workspaces aim to maximize collaboration, increase information access, while restricting access to private or confidential information.

PlaidCloud is broken down into the following levels of access control:

  - Organizations
    - Workspaces
      - Projects

Each progressive layer of control enables administrators to apply access controls and permissions for certain operations.
