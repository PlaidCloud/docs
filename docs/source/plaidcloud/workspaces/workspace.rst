Description
-----------

Workspaces allow an organization to operate as its own cloud based service for both small to large organizations.
For example, small teams may have a single workspace in their organization while large organizations may have hundreds of specialized workspaces.

Workspaces manage access and visibility while providing isolated areas for an organization's members to operate.
Workspace access is assigned to members in a private multi-tenant environment for the organization.  With workspaces,
teams can collaborate on open projects within some workspaces while maintaining strict confidentiality in other workspaces.

Since workspaces are fully isolated, data cannot be directly shared or accessed across workspaces.
However, workspaces can access the same shared Document area if sharing of files is desired between workspaces.

Viewing and Managing Workspaces
---------------------------------

Viewing and managing workspaces within an organization is simple.  

To view and manage workspaces:

1) Select "Organization Settings" from the menu in the upper right of the browser
2) Click "Workspaces"

|organization workspace select|

This will bring you to a table showing all the current workspaces within the organization.  From here you can create, update, suspend, and delete workspaces, add apps to workspaces, and manage member access to each workspace.

Creating a Workspace

Managing Apps Available in Workspace
