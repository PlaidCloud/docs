Description
-----------

User Defined Functions allow unlimited flexibility for handling cases where the standard transforms would be inefficient or where unique logic must be applied.  User defined functions allow interaction with outside services as well as direct interaction with PlaidCloud.

User Defined Transform steps are run as part of workflows like all other steps.  No special setup or configuration is necessary.
