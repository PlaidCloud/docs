Description
-----------

Jupyter Notebook allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and
narrative text. It allows for data visualization, on-demand narrative analysis, ad-hoc analysis, and much more.

 In order to have access to these powerful tools, PlaidCloud provides fully integrated and immediately available
 Jupyter notebooks and supports all of the most common Jupyter notebook use cases.

 In addition to using Jupyter Notebooks on PlaidCloud, you are able to run Jupyter Notebooks locally or on other
 systems and still interact with PlaidCloud the same you would if using Jupyter Notebooks directly on PlaidCloud.
 You can perform the exact same operations elsewhere as long as you have plaid_tools installed.

Click here (https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for additional information from JupyterLab regarding code consoles.

.. todo:: Instructions and screenshots to augment the official documentation coming soon

This ability is **coming soon**! PlaidCloud is currently in the process of developing this capability so, unfortunately,
it is not currently available.  Our team is working hard to build and implement this tool for your use. We appreciate and thank you for your patience.
