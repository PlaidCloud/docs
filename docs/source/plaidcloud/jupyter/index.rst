Description
-----------

PlaidCloud provides access to Jupyter interactive services, a project aimed to develop software and services for
interactive computing across multiple programming languages. This access allows for data analysis and exploration,
including detailed data processing and visualization, through PlaidCloud.

PlaidCloud can provide access to multiple Jupyter services including Jupyter Notebooks, JupyterLab, and JupyterConsole.

JupyterLab and Jupyter Notebooks are common tools used by many data scientists as they provide powerful capabilities
including narrative style data analysis (typically used for qualitative data) and strong ad-hoc
insight (a type of business intelligence.)

From Jupyter, you have access to all the data you have been granted permission to see. You can also utilize the JSON-RPC
processes to interact with other PlaidCloud services directly from JupyterLab and Jupyter Notebooks.

This ability is **coming soon**! PlaidCloud is currently in the process of developing this capability so, unfortunately,
it is not currently available.  Our team is working hard to build and implement this tool for your use. We appreciate
and thank you for your patience.
