Description
-----------

Jupyter Console provides on-demand access to a compute kernel, processes that run interactive code in a 
particular program language, for performing analysis and data exploration operations.

In order to have access to these powerful tools, PlaidCloud provides fully integrated and immediately 
available Jupyter Console use and supports all of the most common Jupyter Console use cases. 

In addition to using Jupyter Console on PlaidCloud, you are able to run Jupyter Console locally or on other 
systems and still interact with PlaidCloud the same you would if using Jupyter Console directly on PlaidCloud. 
You can perform the exact same operations elsewhere as long as you have plaid_tools installed.
