Description
-----------

JupyterLab is an interactive environment for working with notebooks, code, and data. It works hand-in-hand with Jupyter 
notebook by allowing you to use text editors, terminals, data file viewers, and other custom components.JupyterLab 
provides on-demand analysis as well as enabling the construction of both Python methods and processes for data transformation.

In order to have access to these powerful tools, PlaidCloud provides fully integrated and immediately available 
JupyterLab use and supports all of the most common JupyterLab use cases. 

In addition to using JupyterLab on PlaidCloud, you are able to run JupyterLab locally or on other systems and still 
interact with PlaidCloud the same you would if using JupyterLab directly on PlaidCloud. You can perform the exact 
same operations elsewhere as long as you have plaid_tools installed.
