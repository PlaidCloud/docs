Description
-----------

JupyterLab is an interactive environment for working with notebooks, code, and data. It works hand-in-hand with Jupyter notebook by allowing you to use text editors, terminals, data file viewers, and other custom components.JupyterLab provides on-demand analysis as well as enabling the construction of both Python methods and processes for data transformation.

In order to have access to these powerful tools, PlaidCloud provides fully integrated and immediately available JupyterLab use and supports all of the most common JupyterLab use cases. 

In addition to using JupyterLab on PlaidCloud, you are able to run JupyterLab locally or on other systems and still interact with PlaidCloud the same you would if using JupyterLab directly on PlaidCloud. You can perform the exact same operations elsewhere as long as you have plaid_tools installed. 

Click here (https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for additional information from JupyterLab regarding code consoles.

This ability is **coming soon**! PlaidCloud is currently in the process of developing this capability so,unfortuantly, it is not currently availiable.  Our team is working hard to build and implement this tool for your use. We appreciate and thank you for your patience.
