PlaidCloud offers the ability to organize and manage data editors including labels. Data Editors allow editing table data or creating
data by user interaction.

PlaidCloud uses a path based system to organize data editors, like you would use to navigate a series of folders, 
allowing for a more flexible and logical organization (control hierarchy) of the data editors. Using this system, data editors can be moved 
within a control hierarchy or multiple references to one data editor from different locations in the control hierarchy 
(alternate hierarchies) can be created. The ability to manage data editors using this method allows the structure 
to reflect operational needs, reporting, and control.

Searching
---------

Searching for data editors is accomplished by using the filter box in the lower left of the control hierarchy.  The search filter
will search data editors names and labels for matches and show the results in the control hierarhcy above.

Move
--------------------------------

To move a data editor within the control hierarhcy, simply drag it into the folder you wish to place it.


Rename
--------------------------------

Right click on the data editor and select the rename option.  Type in the new name and save it.  The data editor will now be renamed but retain it's original unique identifier.

Delete
--------------------------------

You can delete a single data editor or multiple data editors by selecting the data editors in the control hierarchy then clicking the delete button on the top toolbar.

Create New Directory Structure
--------------------------------

Add a new folder to the control hierarchy by clicking the New Folder button on the to toolbar.  To add a folder to an existing folder, right-click on the folder and select New Folder.

Mark Hierarchy for Viewing Roles
--------------------------------

The viewing of data editors by various roles can be controlled by clicking in the Explorer or Manager checkboxes.  If multiple data editors need to be updated, select the data editors
in the control hierarchy and select the desired viewing role from the Actions menu on the top toolbar.

Memos to Describe Table Contents
--------------------------------

Add a memo to a data editor to help understand the data by selecting the data editor and updating the memo in the right context form.


View Additional Hierarchy Attributes
------------------------------------

Additional data editor attributes are viewable and editable by selecting a data editor and viewing the data editor context form on the right.

Duplicate a Data Editor
--------------------------------

Duplicate a data editor by selecting the data editor and clicking on the Duplicate button on the top toolbar.
