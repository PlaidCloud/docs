PlaidCloud offers the ability to organize and manage tables which, depending on your needs, can be quite a powerful
tool. Tables are available to all workflows within a project and have many tools and options.

Options include:

- The same tables can exist on multiple paths in the hierarchy
- Tables are taggable for easier search and inclusion in PlaidCloud processes
- Tables can be designated as **Source Dependent** or **Source Independent**:
  - Source Dependent - Source dependent tables are not updateable so they cannot be used for Update, Delete, and Append operations but they are highly optimized so steps that use them run extremely fast.  They also automatically update when their underlying sources change.
  - Source Independent - Source independent tables provide independence from their original source which allows for updating the data in the table.  Changes in the source(s) do not alter this table unless a transform modifies the table data.  These are also the suggested table type when publishing tables for reporting.
- Source Independent tables can be versioned


PlaidCloud uses a path based system to organize tables, like you would use to navigate a series of folders, allowing for a more flexible and logical organization of the tables. Using this system, tables can be moved within a hierarchy or multiple references to one table from different locations in the hierarchy (alternate hierarchies) can be created. The ability to manage tables using this method allows the structure to reflect operational needs, reporting, and control.
