Managing Hierarchies
====================

PlaidCloud offers the ability to organize and manage hierarchies including labels. Hierarchies are available to all workflows within a project.

PlaidCloud uses a path based system to organize hierarchies, like you would use to navigate a series of folders, 
allowing for a more flexible and logical organization (control hierarchy) of the hierarchies. Using this system, hierarchies can be moved 
within a control hierarchy or multiple references to one hierarchy from different locations in the control hierarchy 
(alternate hierarchies) can be created. The ability to manage hierarchies using this method allows the structure 
to reflect operational needs, reporting, and control.

Searching
---------

Searching for hierarchies is accomplished by using the filter box in the lower left of the control hierarchy.  The search filter
will search hierarchy names and labels for matches and show the results in the control hierarhcy above.

Move
--------------------------------

To move a hierarchy within the control hierarhcy, simply drag it into the folder you wish to place it.


Rename
--------------------------------

Right click on the hierarchy and select the rename option.  Type in the new name and save it.  The hierarhcy will now be renamed but retain it's original unique identifier.

Clear
--------------------------------

You can clear a single hierarchy or multiple hierarchies by selecting the hierarchies in the control hierarchy then clicking the clear button on the top toolbar.

Delete
--------------------------------

You can delete a single hierarhcy or multiple hierarchies by selecting the hierarchies in the control hierarchy then clicking the delete button on the top toolbar.

The delete operation will check to see if the hierarchy is in use by workflow steps, tables, or views.  If so, you will be asked to remove those associations.

You can also force delete the hierarchy(s).  Force deletion of the hierarchy(s) will leave references broken so this should only be used sparingly.

Create New Directory Structure
--------------------------------

Add a new folder to the control hierarchy by clicking the New Folder button on the to toolbar.  To add a folder to an existing folder, right-click on the folder and select New Folder.

Mark Hierarchy for Viewing Roles
--------------------------------

The viewing of hierarcheis by various roles can be controlled by clicking in the Explorer or Manager checkboxes.  If multiple hierarchies need to be updated, select the hierarchies
in the control hierarchy and select the desired viewing role from the Actions menu on the top toolbar.

Memos to Describe Table Contents
--------------------------------

Add a memo to a hierarchy to help understand the data by selecting the hierarhcy and updating the memo in the right context form.


View Additional Hierarchy Attributes
------------------------------------

Additional hierarchy attributes are viewable and editable by selecting a hierarchy and viewing the hierarhcy context form on the right.

Duplicate a Hierarchy
--------------------------------

Duplicate a hierarhcy by selecting the hierarchy and clicking on the Duplicate button on the top toolbar.
