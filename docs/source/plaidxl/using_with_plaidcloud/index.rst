PlaidXL is not designed to replace the web interface, but rather allow for more analysis focused interactions by using PlaidXL's comprehensive toolset. The toolset enables direct interaction with Workspaces, Projects, Workflows, Tables, Views, and Variables in PlaidCloud. Its abaility to provide a set of PlaidCloud functions aids in managing data analysis processes directly from Excel, which makes analysis easier on you. 


Connecting to PlaidCloud
-------------------------
Connecting to PlaidCloud is much like your login to PlaidCloud directly.  You will be asked for your user, password, and any multi-factor authentication code enabled. Fill this out as normal, and begin using PlaidXL!
